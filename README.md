# Upgrade Your HTML: 10 Examples to Improve Your Markup

This is the source of the short book [_Upgrade Your HTML_](https://meiert.com/blog/upgrade-your-html/).

(Note: The book is written using [Markua](https://markua.com/), which is a superset of Markdown. Some of that code, like `I>` code for info boxes, is not rendered well by GitHub.)
