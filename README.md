Official description:

> HTML is super-popular. Everyone can write HTML. Or can they? In the spirit that perhaps not everyone but _everything_ can, unfortunately, be improved or upgraded, _Upgrade Your HTML_ is a first of a lightweight series to work through real-life examples of HTML and suggest improvements. Not necessarily shyly, nor always thoroughly, and not even that eloquently, and yet in an always constructive manner does Jens Oliver Meiert, or Jens, someone who has written a lot of HTML and who makes his own life very difficult so that he can write more of it, go through ten samples to ponder and upgrade respective markup.

> If you’re a web developer you’ll know HTML. Follow _Upgrade Your HTML_ to nod, to shake your head, to be affirmed in what you know, or offended, or whatever you like to do reading these particular perspectives at old and new problems surrounding the beloved Hypertext Markup Language.
