Official description:

> HTML is super-popular. Everyone can write HTML. Or can they? In the spirit that perhaps not everyone but _everything_ can be improved, _Upgrade Your HTML_ is a first light book in a nonchalant series to work through real-life examples of HTML, and suggest improvements. Not necessarily shyly, nor always thoroughly, and not even that eloquently, and yet in an always constructive manner does Jens Oliver Meiert (just Jens, and almost pronounced like “yes”), someone who has written a lot of HTML and who makes his own life deliberately difficult so that he can write even more HTML, go through ten samples to ponder and upgrade respective markup.

> If you’re a web developer you’ll know HTML. Check out and follow _Upgrade Your HTML_ to nod or to shake your head, maybe even your fists, to be affirmed in what you know, and pleased, or confused, or to do whatever and to feel however you like reading about standard or special perspectives at old and new problems surrounding the beloved Hypertext Markup Language.
