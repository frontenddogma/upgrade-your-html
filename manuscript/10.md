# 10. Add Meaning, Prune Meaninglessness

```html
<div>
  <p><a class="largelink" href="https://www.example.com/ACME/" lang="en" dir="auto" translate="no">Example Antique Commodities Municipality Enterprise (ACME)</a></p>
  <p>Strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the Foo Bar to Baz Scribble.</p>
</div>
```

(Links and text would have given it all away so I “neutralized” the sample.)

This code is from a technical organization. It’s talkative but doesn’t really say much: Some sort of section with two paragraphs, one of which includes a link (and is styled prominently), another that contains a one-liner; and we learn the link is “large” and written in English (like all of the page), that text directionality is “automatic,” and that the contents should not be translated.

The problems with this all is that meaning is not transmitted that is there, and that other code here portrays meaning that is none.

The container, a meaningless `div` element, could be swapped by a slightly more appropriate, slightly more meaningful `section` element.

The first paragraph, and `largelink` suggests what can be seen on the live page, serves more of a heading, which would be preferable, for more—meaningful.

`largelink` is a terrible name because—yes, I’ll give you all of my preference for the “first paradigm” of development that separates concerns—you really don’t want to edit tons of HTML templates and documents once that large link turns small.

The language is English throughout the document and, on scanning (and you can take my word for it again—sorry, but that comes with not pointing fingers at other web developers), it needs no specifying on anchors buried somewhere deep in the page.

Directionality has likewise no need for being defined here, particularly not as `auto`.

`translate=no` is of no interest to the user, other than that it slows them down for it must be loaded together with the other three rather random occurrences on the page that increase overall payload.

The rest is okay.

The way to approach markup—per the school I’ve been taught and that I’ve been teaching—is to write the most minimal meaningful markup possible, and to be really selective about anything else that’s not strictly necessary.

That leads us to the concluding minimal sample suggestion (don’t ask about the necessary heading level here):

```html
<section>
  <h1><a href=/ACME/>Example Antique Commodities Municipality Enterprise (ACME)</a></h1>
  <p>Strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the Foo Bar to Baz Scribble.
</section>
```

If it does meet all the organization’s needs this code looks a bit gentler, doesn’t it? Then you and I have just upgraded that HTML.
