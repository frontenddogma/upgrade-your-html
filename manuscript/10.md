# 10. Add Meaning, Prune Meaninglessness

```html
<div>
  <p><a class="largelink" href="https://www.example.com/ACME/" lang="en" dir="auto" translate="no">A Company Making Everything (ACME)</a></p>
  <p>Strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the World great again.</p>
</div>
```

(Links and text would have given it all away so I “neutralized” the sample.)

This code is from a technical organization. It’s talkative but doesn’t really say much: Some sort of section with two paragraphs, one of which includes a link (and is styled prominently), another that contains a one-liner; and we learn that the link is “large” and written in English (like the rest of the page), that text directionality is “automatic,” and that the contents should not be translated.

The problem with this is that meaning is not conveyed that is there, and that other code here portrays meaning that is none.

The container, a semantically meaningless `div` element, should be swapped by a slightly more appropriate, slightly more meaningful `section` element. (Really only slightly—`section` [doesn’t mean much, either](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-section-element), but one would need to review respective site to determine what other [sectioning](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#sectioning-content-2) or [flow element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#flow-content) was most appropriate.)

The first paragraph, and `largelink` suggests what can be seen on the live page, serves more of a heading. Marking this part up as a heading would be preferable because it carries more meaning.

`largelink` is a terrible name because—yes, I’ll share all of my preference for development that separates concerns—you really don’t want to edit tons of HTML templates and documents once that large link has been redesigned to be small.

The language is English throughout the document and, on closer inspection (as nothing here is about blaming I ask to take my word), needs no specifying on anchors buried deep in the page.

Directionality has likewise no need for being defined here, especially not as `auto`.

`translate=no` is of no interest to the user, other than that it slows them down for it must be loaded together with the other three occurrences on the page that increase overall payload.

Everything else is okay.

The way to approach markup—per the school I’ve been taught and that I’ve been teaching—is to write the most minimal meaningful markup possible, and to be really selective about anything that’s not strictly necessary.

That leads us to the concluding minimal sample suggestion:

```html
<section>
  <h1><a href=/ACME/>A Company Making Everything (ACME)</a></h1>
  <p>Strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the World great again.
</section>
```

If it does meet the organization’s needs this code does look gentler, doesn’t it? Then you and I have upgraded this HTML.
