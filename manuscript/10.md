# 10. Add Meaning, Prune Meaninglessness

```html
<div>
  <p><a class="largelink" href="https://www.example.com/ACME/" lang="en" dir="auto" translate="no">A Company Making Everything (ACME)</a></p>
  <p>Strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the World great again.</p>
</div>
```

(Links and text would have given it all away, so I “neutralized” the sample.)

This code is from a technical organization. It’s talkative but doesn’t say much: some sort of section with two paragraphs, one of which includes a link (one that’s styled prominently), another which contains a one-liner. We learn that the link is “large” and written in English (like the rest of the page), that text directionality is “automatic,” and that the contents should not be translated.

The problem with this is that some code portrays no meaning, and that not all meaning that is there is conveyed.

The container, a semantically meaningless `div` element, should be swapped with a slightly more appropriate, slightly more meaningful `section` element. (Really only slightly—`section` [doesn’t mean much, either](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-section-element), but one would need to review the respective site to determine what other [sectioning](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#sectioning-content-2) or [flow element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#flow-content) was most appropriate.)

The first paragraph, and `largelink` alludes to what we can see on the live page, serves more of a heading. Marking this part up as a heading would be preferable because it carries more meaning.

`largelink` is a terrible name because you don’t want to edit tons of HTML templates and documents once that large link has been redesigned to be small.

The language throughout the document is English and, on closer inspection, needs no additional specifying on anchors buried deep in the page (as nothing here is about blaming, I ask to take that as a given).

Likewise, we don’t need to define directionality here, especially not as `auto`.

`translate=no` is of no interest to the user, other than that it slows them down for it must be loaded together with the other three occurrences on the page that increase overall payload.

The way to approach markup—per the school I’ve been taught and that I’ve been teaching—is to write the most minimal meaningful markup possible, and to be selective about anything that’s not strictly necessary.

That leads us to the concluding minimal sample suggestion:

```html
<section>
  <h1><a href=/ACME/>A Company Making Everything (ACME)</a></h1>
  <p>Strategies, standards, and supporting resources to make the World great again.
</section>
```

If it meets the organization’s needs then this code looks gentler, doesn’t it? We’ve upgraded this HTML.
