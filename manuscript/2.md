# 2. Stop Escaping `&`

…unless you want to make a character reference visible. Now:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,300,400,500,700&amp;lang=en">
```

As with our first case, this example is interesting, too, for there’s more to note. A language (`lang=en`) may not need to be set for a font, one might add back the protocol to force a connection on `https`, one can omit the quotes around `stylesheet`; and, for Google providing the fonts, they could offer a less convenient (for them) but stronger solution (for others) when it comes to privacy by [making it easier to self-host the fonts](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts), so that fonts.googleapis.com cannot collect any traffic information.

Our focus is on the `&amp;` though, used to escape the ampersand in the URL. Yet `&`, in essence, rarely has to be escaped anymore. You can pretty much stop worrying about `&`.

When does `&amp;` need to be escaped? In two cases:

1. To show a character reference (the popular use case). That is, if in the copy of an HTML document you talk about, say, using no-break spaces, you would not type in ` `, for that would yield a space almost indistinguishable from a regular space (` `), but `&amp;nbsp;`. Here you would escape the ampersand.

2. Another case is to avoid what the HTML specification calls [“ambiguous ampersands.”](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#syntax-ambiguous-ampersand) These are, in other words, character sequences of an ampersand, some alphanumeric characters, and a semicolon that could be confused with a sequence that maps to a particular character.

Since it’s rare to run into the second scenario, the only situation to watch out for is when one writes about character references. This happens to be a scenario that takes care of itself, for you wouldn’t have a chance to make a character reference visible if you _didn’t_ escape the leading ampersand.

How can the sample code also work? The suspected non-use for `lang=en` makes us drop the ampersand altogether:

```html
<link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,300,400,500,700">
```

Yet if `lang` was needed:

```html
<link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,300,400,500,700&lang=en">
```

I> In May, 2019, Google [added support for `font-display: swap`](https://www.zachleat.com/web/google-fonts-display/) to Google Fonts. That was great news, and if you’re using the service you may benefit from enabling this option. Jeremy Wagner has a nice write-up on `font-display` that explains [why `swap` is a smart setting](https://css-tricks.com/font-display-masses/#article-header-id-2).
