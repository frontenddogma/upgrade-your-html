# 2. Stop Escaping `&`

…unless you want to show a character reference. Now:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,300,400,500,700&amp;lang=en">
```

As with our first case, this example is interesting, too, for there’s more to improve. A language (note `lang=en`) may probably not need to be set for a font, one might add back the protocol so to force a connection on `https`, and one could omit the quotes around `stylesheet`; and, for Google providing the fonts, one may be able to offer a less convenient but stronger solution when it comes to privacy by [offering the fonts up for self-hosting](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts), so that fonts.googleapis.com doesn’t have to collect a lot of traffic information.

Our focus is on the `&amp;` though, used to escape the ampersand in the URL. Yet `&`, in essence, does rarely have to be escaped anymore. You can pretty much stop worrying about escaping `&`.

When does `&amp;` need to be escaped? Pretty much only in two cases:

1. To show a character reference (the more popular use case). That is, if in a text you talk about, say, using no-break spaces, you would not type in `&nbsp;`, for that would yield a space almost indistinguishable from a regular space (` `), but `&amp;nbsp;`. Here you would escape the ampersand.

2. Another case is to avoid what the specification calls [“ambiguous ampersands.”](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#syntax-ambiguous-ampersand) These are, in other words, character sequences of an ampersand, some alphanumerical characters, and a semicolon that could be confused with a sequence that maps to a particular character.

Since it seems rare to run into the second scenario, the only situation to really watch out for, but one that also takes care of itself (you wouldn’t have any chance to make a character reference visible if you _didn’t_ escape the leading ampersand), is the one in which one writes about character references. Which means that you can stop escaping `&`.

How could the sample code also work? The suspected non-use for `lang=en` makes us drop the ampersand altogether.

```html
<link rel=stylesheet href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,300,400,500,700">
```
