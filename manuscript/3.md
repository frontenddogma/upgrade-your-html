# 3. Think Through Your Markup

```html
<div class="w3-col l3 m6">
  <h3 class="w3-margin-top">Server Side</h3>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href="/sql/default.asp">Learn SQL</a>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href="/php/default.asp">Learn PHP</a>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href='/asp/default.asp'>Learn ASP</a>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href='/nodejs/default.asp'>Learn Node.js</a>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href='/nodejs/nodejs_raspberrypi.asp'>Learn Raspberry Pi</a>
    
  <h3 class="w3-margin-top">Web Building</h3>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href="/w3css/w3css_templates.asp">Web Templates</a>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href="/browsers/default.asp">Web Statistics</a>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href="/cert/default.asp">Web Certificates</a>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href='/tryit/default.asp'>Web Editor</a>
  <a class="w3-bar-item w3-button" href="/whatis/default.asp">Web Development</a>
</div>
```

This example is different, because it serves as a reminder. There are a few ways to approach web development, and the biggest difference these days is the one between the [first and second “paradigm” of web development](https://meiert.com/en/blog/two-paradigms/).

The first paradigm is based on loose coupling and [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), which means to keep apart markup (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript, essentially).

The second paradigm is highly coupled, where CSS is mostly delivered through deep penetration of markup using well presentational classes, and where JavaScript performs manipulation of both HTML and CSS.

I> There are many methods—see e.g. [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), but also [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/)—which give this structure, but there’s no theoretical unity in them apart from all violating the first paradigm and its separation of concerns.

Although a believer in the first paradigm, which in my eyes has never been exhausted so to count as fully explored, nor understood, the idea is not to mandate a particular school of thought—but to instead suggest to review and question your code and _think_ about it.

The example code, then, suffers from basic issues as did former examples—it’s astonishing how many issues one can find in even small code snippets—, like poor semantics (it would work better with `<nav>` and lists), inconsistent formatting (note the use of double and single quotes), and front-loaded navigation terms [impairing scannability](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-2-words-a-signal-for-scanning/) (a usability issue).

One can also find it problematic to repeat oneself so much ([Don’t Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)?). 15 lines of fairly basic code, 10 `w3-bar-item` classes, 10 `w3-button` classes on the very same elements, yet lack of basic meaning. This may all be intended—and let’s assume so—, but the point is, we must think.

Another more minimal way to code the sample is this:

```html
<nav>
  <h3>Server Side</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href=/sql/default.asp>SQL</a>
    <li><a href=/php/default.asp>PHP</a>
    <li><a href=/asp/default.asp>ASP</a>
    <li><a href=/nodejs/default.asp>Node.js</a>
    <li><a href=/nodejs/nodejs_raspberrypi.asp>Raspberry Pi</a>
  </ul>
  <h3>Web Building</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href=/w3css/w3css_templates.asp>Templates</a>
    <li><a href=/browsers/default.asp>Statistics</a>
    <li><a href=/cert/default.asp>Certificates</a>
    <li><a href=/tryit/default.asp>Editors</a>
    <li><a href=/whatis/default.asp>Web Development</a>
  </ul>
</nav>
```
