# 4. Don’t Double Boolean Attributes

```html
<script async='async' src='https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js'></script>
```

From an Indian website; and here, let’s have a look at [the HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attributes).

> A number of attributes are boolean attributes. The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.
>
> If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or a value that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the attribute’s canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.
>
> The values “true” and “false” are not allowed on boolean attributes. To represent a false value, the attribute has to be omitted altogether.

`checked`, `disabled`, `selected` are popular examples for boolean attributes. `async` is a boolean attribute, too. Unless you’re [truly](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/xhtml.html) using and delivering XHTML, doubling these attributes is not necessary. Don’t.

The minimum for the sample code would simply be:

```html
<script src=https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js async></script>
```
