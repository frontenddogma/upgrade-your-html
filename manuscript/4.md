# 4. Don’t Double Boolean Attributes

```html
<script async='async' src='https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js'></script>
```

From an Indian website; let’s start with a look at [the HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attributes).

> A number of attributes are boolean attributes. The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the “true” value, and the absence of the attribute represents the “false” value.
>
> If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or a value that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the attribute’s canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.
>
> The values “true” and “false” are not allowed on boolean attributes. To represent a false value, the attribute has to be omitted altogether.

`checked`, `disabled`, `selected` are popular examples for [the Boolean attributes](https://meiert.com/blog/boolean-attributes-of-html/). `async` is a Boolean attribute, too. Unless you’re [truly](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/xhtml.html) using and delivering XHTML, doubling these attributes isn’t necessary. Don’t.

The minimum for the sample code is:

```html
<script src=https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js async></script>
```
