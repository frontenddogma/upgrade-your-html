# 5. If It Can Be Done Using an HTTP Header, Use an HTTP Header

```html
<meta http-equiv="Last-Modified" content="Monday, 07 October, 2019 02:21:47AM">
<meta name="Last-Modified" content="Monday, 07 October, 2019 02:21:47AM">
<meta name="Last-Modified-Date" content="Mon, Oct 07, 2019">
<meta name="Last-Modified-Time" content="02.21AM IST">
```

There are a number of things you can control in HTML that can also be controlled on the domain or protocol level. For example, aspects related to [security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy), [performance](http://cristian.sulea.net/blog/disable-browser-caching-with-meta-html-tags/), or, as in the example, [redirects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections) ([`meta` elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-meta-element) are [infamous when it comes to redirects](https://help.ahrefs.com/en/articles/2433739-what-is-meta-refresh-redirect-and-why-is-it-considered-a-critical-issue)), even [verification](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080) and [indexing](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93710). Whenever that’s the case, you’re better off working with said domain or protocol level.

The reason? Maintainability, for centralization through domain or HTTP configuration makes it a lot easier, faster, and reliable to manage changes.

In this case, for example, most servers already respond to a request with a `Last-Modified` header. (The other two headers seem non-standard, but can be provided, too, if necessary.) The server the example site is on is no exception:

```
Last-Modified: Mon, 07 Oct 2019 21:21:47 GMT
```

While the sample code gives room for speculation—what was the motivation to add all this meta markup? why not in the [standard `Last-Modified` format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Last-Modified)?—, the lesson is to use HTTP headers if HTTP headers can be used. Because the best HTML is sometimes no HTML, as with the optimized minimal example code:

```html
```

I> An anecdote: It’s theoretically possible—my last [test](https://hell.meiert.org/core/php/link.php) dates back a while, and only Firefox just passed it again—to also assign style sheets through HTTP headers. The way it works is described [in the old HTML 4.01 spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/styles.html#h-14.6):
I>
I> > Web server managers may find it convenient to configure a server so that a style sheet will be applied to a group of pages. The HTTP `Link` header has the same effect as a `LINK` element with the same attributes and values. Multiple `Link` headers correspond to multiple `LINK` elements occurring in the same order.
I>
I> This allows to issue a header like
I>
I> ```
I> Link: <https://example.com/default.css>; REL=stylesheet
I> ```
I>
I> to be equivalent to:
I>
I> ```html
I> <link rel=stylesheet href=https://example.com/default.css>
I> ```
I>
I> This is the simplest way and the least work to create a style sheet reference—theoretically the _only_ reference for an entire project. If this worked everywhere you had my full recommendation to always and only set your default style sheet like this!
