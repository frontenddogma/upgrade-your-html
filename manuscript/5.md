# 5. If It Can Be Done Using an HTTP Header, Use an HTTP Header

```html
<meta http-equiv="Last-Modified" content="Monday, 07 October, 2019 02:21:47AM">
<meta name="Last-Modified" content="Monday, 07 October, 2019 02:21:47AM">
<meta name="Last-Modified-Date" content="Mon, Oct 07, 2019">
<meta name="Last-Modified-Time" content="02.21AM IST">
```

There are a number of things you can control in HTML that can also be controlled on the domain or protocol level. For example, [security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) and, as with the example, [caching](http://cristian.sulea.net/blog/disable-browser-caching-with-meta-html-tags/), but also [verification](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080) and [indexing](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93710). Whenever that’s the case, you should work with said domain or protocol level.

The reason? Maintainability, for the centralization that domain or HTTP configuration allow make it a lot easier, faster, and reliable to manage changes.

In this case, for example, most servers would already respond to a request with a `Last-Modified` header. (The other two headers seem non-standard, but could be set up, too, if necessary.) Even for the server the example’s site is on, this has already been set up:

```
Last-Modified: Mon, 07 Oct 2019 21:21:47 GMT
```

While the example gives room for speculation—what motivated them to add all this meta markup? why not in the [standard `Last-Modified` format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Last-Modified)?—, the point is really to use HTTP headers if HTTP headers can be used. Because the best HTML is sometimes no HTML, as with the optimized minimal example code:

```html
```

I> A little anecdote: It’s theoretically possible—my last [test](https://hell.meiert.org/core/php/link.php) dates back a while, and only Firefox just passed it again—to also assign style sheets through HTTP headers. The way it works is described most clearly perhaps [in the old HTML 4.01 spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/styles.html#h-14.6):
I>
I> ```
I> Link: <https://example.com/default.css>; REL=stylesheet
I> ```
I>
I> …which is equivalent to:
I>
I> ```html
I> <link rel=stylesheet href=https://example.com/default.css>
I> ```
I>
I> If this worked everywhere you had my full recommendation to always and only set your default style sheet this way!
