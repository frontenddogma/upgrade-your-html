# 6. Avoid `data` Images

```html
<img class="send-me-acme" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAACnej3aAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAApJREFUeAFjZAAAAAQAAhq+CAMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Send me to build ACME I want" />
```

This example is from a South African website, and I replaced the three pages of image code with a 1×1 pixels “spacer,” and _one_ word with “ACME.”

Although said three pages of code won’t catch your eye now, there isn’t really a good reason anymore to use Base64-encoded images directly embedded in production HTML (“`data` images”).

Why?

Some people have done [a bit of math](https://www.andygup.net/a-closer-look-at-base64-image-performance/) to look at how much `data` images actually save with the HTTP request that they allow to skip, and what overhead `data` images come with.

But a look at the general pros and cons is instructive as well; note the pros for `data` images:

* Fewer HTTP requests (one each)

…and the cons:

* Larger payload (`data` images are a little bigger than their “regular” counterparts)
* Impaired code understanding (even with tooling and syntactic sugar, respective code will be harder for different to read)
* Increased need for tooling (to generate and integrate respective images)

For these reasons (as well as improved support of [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)) we, our field, have only for a brief period of time, say, from 2010–2015, made more use of `data` images. Unless you have good reasons to use them, avoid them.

Case in point:

```html
<img src=acme.png alt="Send me the ACME I want?" class=send-me-acme>
```
