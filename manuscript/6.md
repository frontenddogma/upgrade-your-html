# 6. Avoid `data` Images

```html
<img class="send-me-acme" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAACnej3aAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAApJREFUeAFjZAAAAAQAAhq+CAMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Send me to build ACME I want" />
```

This chapter’s example is from a South African website, and I replaced the three pages of image code with a 1×1 pixels “spacer,” and one word with “ACME.”

Although said three pages of code won’t catch your eye now, there isn’t a good reason anymore to use Base64-encoded images—`data` images—directly embedded in production HTML.

Why?

For one, there’s a little [bit of math](https://www.andygup.net/a-closer-look-at-base64-image-performance/) that people have done to look at how much `data` images actually save with the HTTP request that they allow to skip, and what overhead `data` images come with.

For another, it’s instructive to look at the pros and cons as well; note the pros for `data` images:

* fewer HTTP requests (one each),

…as well as the cons:

* larger payload (`data` images are a little bigger than their “regular” counterparts),
* impaired code understanding (even with tooling and syntactic sugar, respective code is harder to read in comparison with the embedding of regular images), and
* increased need for tooling (to generate and integrate respective images).

For these reasons as well as improved support of [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) have we, our field, only for a brief period of time, roughly from 2010–2015, made more use of `data` images. Unless you have good reasons to use them, avoid them.

Case in point:

```html
<img src=acme.png alt="Send me the ACME I want?" class=send-me-acme>
```
