# 7. Don’t Use the Classic “Clearfix”

```html
<div class="clearfix"></div>
```

In 2005, Anne van Kesteren, a web standards developer, wrote the following [about clearing floats](https://annevankesteren.nl/2005/03/clearing-floats):

> Have you ever floated something to a side and wondered why the outer element did not increase its height? That is probably because the outer element had a visible overflow instead of non-visible overflow.

And he continued proposing a solution:

> So when you set an `overflow` property with a value of `auto` to the outer `DIV` element things will probably work just fine […].

(You can replace said `div` with any other container.)

This was in _2005_.

Still in _2019_, a widespread approach to clearing floats uses a lot more CSS, and even extra HTML (and then poorly named per common [conventions for CSS IDs and classes](https://meiert.com/en/blog/best-practice-ids-and-classes/)). The CSS for one of the [more popular editions](https://css-tricks.com/clearfix-a-lesson-in-web-development-evolution/) of this “clearfix,” as it became known, is something like:

```css
.clearfix:after {
  clear: both;
  content: '.'; 
  display: block; 
  height: 0;
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

Like others, I’ve at some point [dedicated an article](https://meiert.com/en/blog/no-clearfix/) to the clearfix and its issues, but because it’s still so common and popular it’s important to make sure, in this place as well, to improve your HTML by _not_ using it. You don’t need it, because if you do float something, add `overflow: auto;` (or, a more recent and [increasingly better supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flow-root) approach, [`display: flow-root;`](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/01/24/the-end-of-the-clearfix-hack/)) to its parent container. In most cases that’s sufficient.

Because of this, the minimum solution once more looks like (no HTML):

```html
```

T> I said “in most cases.” In case of emergency (which I haven’t experienced in my own projects) and when absolutely nothing but a “clearfix” would save the day, go for the simplest solution you can find. For a one-off problem, add clearfix CSS to the parent element in question. For a recurring problem either group the respective elements’ selectors, or invent your own helper class.
