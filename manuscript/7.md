# 7. Don’t Use the Classic “clearfix”

```html
<div class="clearfix"></div>
```

In 2005, Anne van Kesteren (a web standards developer), wrote the following [about clearing floats](https://annevankesteren.nl/2005/03/clearing-floats):

> Have you ever floated something to a side and wondered why the outer element did not increase its height? That is probably because the outer element had a visible overflow instead of non-visible overflow.

And he continued with the solution:

> So when you set an `overflow` property with a value of `auto` to the outer `DIV` element things will probably work just fine […].

(You could replace said `div` with any other container.)

This was in _2005_.

In _2019_, using extra HTML and extra CSS is still a wide-spread way of clearing floats, and it’s often called “clearfix”, quite literally, despite the poor naming per pretty much any known [convention for CSS IDs and classes](https://meiert.com/en/blog/best-practice-ids-and-classes/).

I’ve at some point [dedicated an article](https://meiert.com/en/blog/no-clearfix/) to this issue, too, but because the “clearfix” is still so common and popular it’s important to make sure, in this place as well, to upgrade your HTML by not using any of them. You don’t need them, because if you do float something, just add `overflow: auto;` to its parent container and in most cases, everything’s fine.

Because of this, the minimum solution here once more looks like this:

```html
