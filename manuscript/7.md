# 7. Don’t Use the Classic “clearfix”

```html
<div class="clearfix"></div>
```

In 2005, Anne van Kesteren, a web standards developer, wrote the following [about clearing floats](https://annevankesteren.nl/2005/03/clearing-floats):

> Have you ever floated something to a side and wondered why the outer element did not increase its height? That is probably because the outer element had a visible overflow instead of non-visible overflow.

And he continued proposing a solution:

> So when you set an `overflow` property with a value of `auto` to the outer `DIV` element things will probably work just fine […].

(You can replace said `div` with any other container.)

This was in _2005_.

In _2019_, using extra HTML and CSS still means a wide-spread approach to clearing floats (all poorly named per pretty much any known [convention for CSS IDs and classes](https://meiert.com/en/blog/best-practice-ids-and-classes/)). The CSS for one of the [more popular editions](https://css-tricks.com/clearfix-a-lesson-in-web-development-evolution/) of the “clearfix,” as it became known, would then be something like:

```css
.clearfix:after {
  clear: both;
  content: '.'; 
  display: block; 
  height: 0;
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

I’ve at some point [dedicated an article](https://meiert.com/en/blog/no-clearfix/) to the “clearfix” and its issues, too, but because it’s still so common and popular it’s important to make sure, in this place as well, to improve your HTML by not using it. You don’t need it, because if you do float something, just add `overflow: auto;` (or, a more recent and [increasingly better supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flow-root) approach, [`display: flow-root;`](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/01/24/the-end-of-the-clearfix-hack/)) to its parent container. In most cases, everything’s fine then.

Because of this, the minimum solution here once more looks like (no HTML):

```html
```

I> I said “in most cases.” In case of emergency (which I haven’t experienced in my own projects) and when absolutely nothing but a “clearfix” would save the day, go for the simplest solution you can find. For a one-off problem, add respective CSS to the parent element in question. For a recurring problem either group respective elements’ selectors, or invent your own helper class.
