# 8. Be Clear About Attribute Functions

```html
<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">Main Page</h1>
```

This sample is another fairly short one, taken from a fairly popular, fairly huge information site. Now, you and I will and perhaps should assume good reasons and intentions, but on the surface more than just one thing feels off: Is this a useful heading title? (Is it indeed the first-level heading?) Why does it need the language assigned when it is (and it is) on an all-English page? And what’s up with this duplication of `class` and `id`?

We won’t know reasons and intentions without talking to developers and stakeholders (and, unfortunately, we won’t talk to them). I’ve picked this example to focus on the duplicate class and ID issue. This is something to be mindful of, for it suggests that one hadn’t been entirely clear about what role which attribute plays on the site.

Is the `id` just for reference, for naming or identification, for styling, or for scripting manipulation? Is the `class` serving naming or identification, styling, or scripting? And this is the confusing piece, then—both attribute-value combinations overlap in what they can be used for. It seems conceivable that the `id` was established for reference (to jump right to the heading) and naming, and the `class` for styling; but even if the organization’s documentation and coding guidelines documented this, it’s conceivable that the duplication confuses developers.

Conceivable.

Avoiding such _de facto_ duplication can save code and make markup more understandable.

The minimal markup scenario may yield the following:

```html
<h1>Main Page</h1>
```

Or, to go by our field’s class-rich “second paradigm”:

```html
<h1 class=firstHeading>Main Page</h1>
```

Something like that, if you’re happy naming classes this way.
