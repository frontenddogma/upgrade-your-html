# 9. Question Your Frontend Code

156,134—125,478—23,152.

Three numbers—with the code they represent this booklet would be three times as long.

The numbers come from the homepage—and solely the homepage document—of a Chinese website, and mean the following:

* 156,134 characters overall, of which
* 125,478 characters are JavaScript, and
* 23,152 characters are CSS.

In ratios, 80,37% of this homepage consists of JavaScript, and 14,83% of CSS. All inline.

If this happens, something goes wrong.

Either all that JavaScript and CSS is being reused somewhere and should therefore _not_ be inlined, because the performance benefits of inlining are outweighed by the caching, maintainability, and tooling benefits of not inlining, that is, of making the scripts and style sheets available separately.

Or, that JavaScript and CSS is way too large, and development itself went wrong. (The sample page is rather simple and I question—and almost like to rule out—that so much code was indeed necessary.)

Still, why write about HTML and then throw numbers around? Let’s try a different way of describing the problem:

You write 7,504 characters of HTML and copy (and _many_ spaces).

Then you write 23,152 characters of CSS—4 times as much HTML, and _compressed_ this time—, to style that markup (and _only_ that markup, for you inline all the CSS because you don’t reuse it anywhere else).

And then you write _125,478_ characters of JavaScript—no spaces here, either, that is, all minified, then amounting to _17_ times more code than you wrote HTML.

Well.

I’ve looked at one site to compare (only one, but at least one), where I found 19,520 characters of HTML and copy and whitespace; and 8,439 characters of CSS _for the whole_ website. You can tell where this is going:

Something is off when you write a one-pager and your HTML/copy to CSS/script ratio is 1:20. And then a standard website with shared assets clocks in at 2:1. The ratio flipped. One entire dimension smaller.

Think, again, and question your work.
