With the speed of web development today, it’s little wonder that so many frameworks are available, since they come with a promise of saving development and design time. But using the wrong framework, or wrongly using the right framework, can be costly. This concise book shares higher-level ideas around web development frameworks that govern HTML and CSS code, whether you’re looking at an external option or planning to build your own.

This is the book that the most boring person would write when it found a life and had too much time at his hands. Meet Jens, a hectic, neurotic self-proclaimed adventurer, and his very individual account of one hundred different activities he’s tried over the last three years (2010–2013). From crocheting to security guard certifications to rafting, everything had a lesson, and these lessons are shared in this book. Expect the German answer to Winston Wolfe to explain how to live a life, in his own words.
