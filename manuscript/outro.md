# Outro

Upgrade Your HTML—or was this all Downgrade Your HTML? You’ve read ten short chapters and have encountered as many samples of HTML that got discussed and minimized.

Is this just correlation, or was there a mistake, that all these upgrades resulted in less code? Is less code an upgrade all by itself?

Specializing in using as little code as possible, and loving the idea of [“minimal web development,”](https://meiert.com/en/blog/minimal-web-development/) I’m biased. Yet I believe there’s a strong correlation. Sometimes, more markup will lead to improvements and upgrades—making sure an image gets its `alt` attribute, for example—, but oftentimes, it’s _less_ code that improves matters, for less code reflects focus, improves performance, understanding, and maintainability.

As with many rules, there are exceptions to this one, and yet I don’t find it surprising that what this little book shows is that improvements often come with removing rather than adding code.

The aspect I like to close with, however, is a different one: There are always things to improve. (Even if [Jesus or another amazing person joined us in this conversation](https://meiert.com/en/blog/destroying-is-not-arguing/), right this moment, someone could and would find something objectionable about that.) Yet, as that, as the examples, as I tried to show, that’s not a negative thing, for if there’s _always_ something to improve, it doesn’t mean that what was there before was necessarily “bad.” It’s also _constructive_ to make suggestions for suspected improvements, especially when there’s reason to believe that these do, indeed, solve what’s been pointed out as problems.

Making constructive suggestions around actual uses of HTML has been the idea of this booklet. It’s likewise the idea for a series of such writings, similarly brief—for there are always things to improve, for there’s always HTML to, you name it: upgrade.

Thank you for following along, and the best wishes to you, and your HTML.

PS.
If you like to learn from other HTML blunders without waiting for _Upgrade Your HTML II_, have a look at [Manuel Matuzović’s “HTMHell.”](https://www.htmhell.dev/) HTMHell shares the same spirit as _Upgrade Your HTML_, and Manuel does a great job explaining issues with HTML and how to avoid or fix them.
