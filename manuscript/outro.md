# Outro

Upgrade Your HTML—or was this all Downgrade Your HTML? You’ve just read or scanned ten short chapters and have encountered as many samples of HTML from the wild to be discussed and minimized.

Is this just correlation, or was there a mistake, that all these upgrades resulted in less code? Is less code an upgrade all by itself?

Specializing in using as little code as possible, and loving the idea of [“minimal web development,”](https://meiert.com/en/blog/minimal-web-development/) I’m biased. Yet I believe there’s a strong correlation here. Sometimes, more markup will lead to improvements and upgrades—making sure an image gets its `alt` attribute, for example—, but oftentimes, it’s less code that improves matters, for less code reflects focus, improves performance, understanding, and maintainability.

As with many a rule, there are exceptions to this one, and yet I don’t find it surprising that what this little book shows is that improvements often come with removing rather than adding code.

The aspect I like to close with, however, is a different one: There are always things to improve. (Even if [Jesus or another important person joined us in this conversation](https://meiert.com/en/blog/destroying-is-not-arguing/), right this moment, someone could and would find something objectionable about that.) Yet, as that, as the examples, as I tried to show, that’s not a negative thing, for if there’s _always_ something to improve, it doesn’t mean that what was there before was necessarily “bad.” It’s _constructive_ to make suggestions for suspected improvements, especially when there’s reason to believe that these do, indeed, solve what’s been pointed out as problems.

Making constructive suggestions around actual uses of HTML has been the idea of this very brief book. It’s likewise the idea for a series of such books, similarly brief—for there are always things to improve, for there is always HTML to, you name it: upgrade.

Thank you for following along, and the best wishes to you, and your HTML.
